The purpose of this branch is to follow the example of generating a Garch(1,1) price signal for the Gasoil daily open returns signal, as inspired by a similar example from the mmquant blog. 
There is a One Note blog called R1_Garch Blog Post that accompanies this code.

From what I can tell this branch is redundant now and can be either merged into Master (should be risk free as all the files will already exist here), or delete. 
I'm not worried about deleting as I should have everything that I need.
