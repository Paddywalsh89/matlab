This branch goes through generating a ARIMA-Garch(1,1) model for Gasoil following the steps outlined by mmquant. 

This changes on this branh go through the mmquant example to the end, using an AR-Garch approach for Gasoil. 
It was found that the ARIMA part of the code was not really relevant to Gasoil, thus, I will leave this branch as is 
and start a new branch where I look at Garch(1,1) only for the volatility model.
